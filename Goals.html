    <p style="text-align: center;font-size: 20;">This is the folder for the website</p>
    
    <p style="text-align: center;">My goals for this year, despite these circumstances, is to get a firm grasp of html. This site, although not the prettiest, is my first step into learning. I used a lot of css to try to improve the look, but it definitely still has that first time "htmler" look </p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">I realized that JavaScript could also be used to improve a site. This would be a great thing to learn and I'm very interested.

    <p style="text-align: center;">Hopefully, by the end of this year, I can make my sites not look like I haven't been using html for long. It reminds me of editing a video in Windows Movie Maker, but trying to make it look like a normal video rather than the god awful transitions that it provides to mask the fact that I'm using crappy software </p>
